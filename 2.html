  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>During my time in the Republic of Korea Air Force, my responsibilities included
  inspection, repair and maintenance of various aircraft machinery, components and
  equipment. I often worked in groups, and learned to work together with members of my
  team to complete tasks on a deadline. My military experience also taught me discipline,
  and I have an excellent work ethic as a result.</p><p style="margin-top:30px">While working as an Aircraft Component Technician at Aeropol Aviation
Services, I have achieved assembly, disassembly, and inspection skills, as well as test
equipment experience. Since I carry out maintenance tasks with many different aircraft
components in accordance with Component Maintenance Manual (CMM), Service
Bulletins (SB) and Airworthiness Directives (AD), I can easily follow and interpret
technical drawings and instructions.<p>Currently, I am working as an Aircraft Engine Assembler at Pratt & Whitney Canada.</p>
